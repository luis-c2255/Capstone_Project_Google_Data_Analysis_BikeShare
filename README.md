# 💡 About this Course 

## Introduction 

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**.

## Scenario 

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
